## Projects

### Data Visualization and Storytelling
<a href="https://bayyangjie.github.io/Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling"> <b> Analysis of relationship between conflict and food aid in Sub-Saharan Africa </b>

Completed a project that involved extracting a dataset from the World Development Indicators(WDI) to understand the association between conflict, aid provision, disasters, and economic indicators.Employed R to clean, process the data and formulate visualizations for analysis. Various R packages were employed such as dplyr, ggplot2, tidyverse to perform an end-to-end data analytics process starting from data import, data processing and understanding and then data visualization and analysis. <br> <br>

### Data Wrangling
<a href="https://bayyangjie.github.io/Data-Wrangling"> <b> Analysis of hospital patient experiences </b>

In this project, I assembled a data flow between MySQL, Python and R to create a reproducible workflow process. Additionally, I also utilized Python to read in multiple datasets, and then using MySQL to subset columns for creating a new table record. The new SQL table record was then read into R for regression and visualization analysis. <br> <br>

### Applied Statistical Methods and Causal Analysis
<a href="https://bayyangjie.github.io/Applied-Statistical-Methods-and-Causal-Analysis"> <b> Analysis of discount treatment effect on supermarket sales </b>

Performed EDA on a dataset of supermarket stores. R was used to summarize, visualize, and explore the data to gain insights and understanding. Statistical analysis together with hypothesis testing were then employed to identify the effect of discounts on sales as part of the analysis objective. <br> <br>

### Hyperautomation
<a href="https://bayyangjie.github.io/Hyperautomation"> <b> Hyperautomation solutions for process optimization </b>

Constructed a workflow that utilized UiPath automation to receive an input, auto-evaluate the data and provide an output to address an enterprise function problem. The use case was the creation of an after-sales survey form which could be reused multiple times.

### Foundation to Python for AI
<a href="https://bayyangjie.github.io/Foundation-to-Python-for-AI"> <b> Customer segmentation using clustering analysis </b>

In this project, Python was utilized for applying clustering techniques to group customers based on their credit card usage patterns to tailor marketing strategies and services effectively. Specifically, KMeans clustering was employed for the analysis to segment customers into different groups and further study the profiles of each cluster. Subsequently. leveraging upon the clustering results and visualisations, insights and recommendations were suggested for the company to formulate targeted marketing strategies/service improvements.

### Data Analytics for Decision Makers
<a href="https://bayyangjie.github.io/Data-Analytics-for-Decision-Makers"> <b> Analysis of hotel reviews and ratings </b>

This project was carried out based on the CRISP-DM framework. Using a provided dataset and the SPSS Modeler software, data analytical steps were executed from formulating business problems to be addressed and the analytical techniques to be used, data understanding & preparation to data analysis and finally evaluation & discussion. Techniques such as Clustering and Predictive Modelling were utilized for this project to cluster customers based on various parameters and then leverage the results to make predictions based on the review behaviours of customers.

### Data Integration for Enterprise Automation
